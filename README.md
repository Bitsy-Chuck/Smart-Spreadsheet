# Smart Spreadsheet

## Introduction

The goal of this project is showcase your learning, engineering and problem solving capability. The project is open-ended. There is no single right answer.

## Scenario

You are the engineer leading the product development. We just received a request from a key client to build an AI that can answer questions from Excel files. The timeline is tight. We have two days to develop this feature. 

Now, you're retuning to work, and are starting to think about how we can deliever it to our client.

In the repo, there is example Excel files that the client shared with us. There are also some functions we developed to give you a head start.  

## Goals

1. The algorithm should be able to parse and serialize each individual table in the Excel sheet `example_0.xlsx`.
2. An AI chat function that should be able to answer basic question about the excel sheet, e.g. "What is the Total Cash and Cash Equivalent of Nov. 2023?" (No UI is needed)
3. Let's make the algorithm more generalizable. Can you make it parse `example_1.xlsx` and `example_2.xlsx`?
4. Let's make the AI more intelligent. Can you make it answer questions that needs to be inferred like "What is the Total Cash and Cash Equivalent of Oct. and Nov. of 2023?"
5. Now we have an amazing Smart Spreadsheet AI. Let's deploy it for our user to use!

## FAQ

1. How long do I have to solve the problem? 

You have two days to sovle the problem. 

2. What tools, tech stack shall I use? 

Whatever you can. There is no limitation. And yes, you can use ChatGPT and we encourage it.

3. Do I have to achieve all the goals? 

We will be very impressed if you can! But it's not a requirement. Go as far as you can!

4. How to submit?

Please fork the repo, and submit your solution in a branch of your own repo and share the link of your repo with us via email.

## Remarks

We appreicate the time you will devote to this project. We hope you enjoy this exercise!
