# Smart Spreadsheet

## Introduction

The goal of this project is showcase your learning, engineering and problem solving abilities. The project is open-ended. There is no single right answer.

## Scenario

You are an engineer leading product development at Capix. We just received a request from a key client to build an AI that can answer questions from Excel files. The timeline is tight. We have two days to develop this feature. How should we deliver this to our client?


In the repo, there are example Excel files that the client has shared with us. There are also some functions we developed to give you a head start.  

## Goals

1. The algorithm should be able to parse and serialize each individual table in the Excel sheet `example_0.xlsx`.
2. An AI chat function that should be able to answer basic question about the excel sheet, e.g. "What is the Total Cash and Cash Equivalent of Nov. 2023?" (No UI is needed)
3. Let's make the algorithm more generalizable. Can you make it parse `example_1.xlsx` and `example_2.xlsx`?
4. Let's make the AI more intelligent. Can you make it answer questions that need to be inferred like "What is the Total Cash and Cash Equivalent of Oct. AND Nov. of 2023 combined?"
5. Now that we have a Smart Spreadsheet AI. Let's deploy it for our user to use!

## FAQ

1. How long do I have to solve the problem? 

You have two days to sovle the problem. 

2. What tools, tech stack should I use? 

Whatever tools you want. There are no particular requirements. And yes, you can use ChatGPT and we encourage it.

3. Do I have to achieve all the goals? 

We will be very impressed if you can! Go as far as you can!

4. How to submit?

Please fork the repo, and submit your solution in a branch of your own repo and share the link of your repo with us via email.

## Remarks

We appreicate the time you will devote to this project. We hope you enjoy this exercise!
